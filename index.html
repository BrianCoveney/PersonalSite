                This is a basic Android ToDo application. The user can enter the name and description of a task(s) on the landing page, it is then presented in a listview. The user can tap on one of these tasks which opens up another activity, where they can add a time and date to the task. Once finished the user can save the task (to local storage), or email the task.
            </p>
            <p>
                The app asks the user for permissions when first being installed. It integrates Google Play Services which communicates with the Google API Client. From either the top menu bar or the slide in menu, the user can toggle location services to find the precise current location, or they can open a Google Map activity.

                This is a Java Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) application built using the Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern.</p>
            <p>
                The Model here represents the Player, Team and Country Objects. It is also responsible for persisting data to a MySQL Database.
            </p>
            <p>
                The View contains the Graphical User Interface (GUI) , which is built with the Swing API.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Controller is responsible for separating concerns between the Model and View sections.
                Its controls the user input from the GUI into the Model object, and also updates the View when data   has changed.
