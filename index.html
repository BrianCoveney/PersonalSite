                I am a recent Software Development BSc (Hons) Graduate at Cork Institute of Technology, where I completed my degree in May 2018.
            </p>
            <p>
                This has involved first completing the Higher Certificate in Computing and the BSc (Ord) in Computing. Then, transferring to Software Development BSc (Hons)
                in 2017.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://briancoveney.github.io/CoveneyArchitects/index.html">Coveney & Associates Architects</a> <span>(1998 - 2012)</span>
                    <p>
                        In Coveney & Associates I was responsible for creating planning, tender and construction
                        drawings, based on the brief of the lead Architect. Projects involved working with an
                        interdisciplinary team of structural engineers, roads engineers, surveyors, planners and
                        builders.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The company used AutoCAD, which is a computer-aided software tool, to create
                        the drawings. When I first started working with Coveney & Associates, AutoCAD was still
                        very new, and the architects at the time still created their drawings by hand. I took many
                        training courses, during my time there, to stay up-to-date with the continuously updating
                        software package and to improve my skills.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was also very important that our projects
                        were delivered on time, on budget and to regulation specification. Alongside the architect, I
                        attended site meetings and adapted the project’s drawings as needed.
                        As a result of the recession and collapse of the construction sector in Ireland, I was made
                        redundant in 2012. Due to my interest in technology, I was delighted to get a place in CIT,
                        doing a BSc in Computing

                        While in the process of completing my degree, I worked on the iOS team, part-time,
                        remotely. The products I was responsible for supporting included: iPhone, iPad, Apple
                        Watch, Apple TV and iTunes. Working with Apple was at times a high-pressure
                        environment, especially when a new product or iOS update was launched. There were
                        weekly reviews with targets set by my manager to improve on metrics, such as customer
                        satisfaction score (CSAT) and call duration. I was able to keep a very high CSAT
                        and other metric scores during my time there. I was also continuously assessed in the
                        self-guided study assigned. This helped me keep up to date on the products and services.
                        I enjoyed working at Apple, particularly getting to the root of an issue a customer was having
